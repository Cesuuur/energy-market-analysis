# Energy-market-analysis

Energy market analysis for final degree project in bussines managent degree.

If someone reads this code, forgive me...it's a disaster but economics is the study 
of the allocation of scarce resources :D 

In the repository the pdf is attached in case anyone is curious, there you can find more theory and
some conclusions. The work can also be improved, it must be put in context, it is the work of a student,
who is introduced to a field of complex statistics...

Next we comment the summary of the work:

  This paper analyzes the dynamic and marginal properties of the distribution of the
  returns from the energy market (oil, gas and coal) in order to see if
  present a series of characteristics (Stylized Facts) that have already been widely
  documented in the yields of financial assets. 

  The final degree project begins by describing the energy markets and the data to be analyzed,
  then descriptive statistics techniques and normality tests are applied to
  analyze the characteristics of the marginal distributions of returns,
  then the dynamic properties are analyzed through autocorrelations and
  cross-correlations of different yield transformations. Finally,
  the sensitivity of the dynamic properties in the presence of data is reviewed
  atypical.
